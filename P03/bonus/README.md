An intentionally-incorrect version of class Student has been provided
in the file named Student_fail.java. Replacing Student.java with the
contents of this file will cause the following failures to be reported:

FAIL: Expected name as Prof Rice but was ~Prof Rice

FAIL: Expected average with no grades as 100 but was NaN

FAIL: Expected 2-grade average as 90 but was 180.0

FAIL: Error code is 7

This is my "testing the test" work, to ensure the test will in fact
detect errors in class Student!
