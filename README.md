# CSE1325-001 and 002
## Fall 2021

This repository includes code that complements each lecture, suggested solutions for each assignment, and additional example code for my Object-Oriented Programming in Java class.

## Cloning to your local machine

To create a folder in your virtual machine that is linked to this repository, go to your home directory (e.g., ``cd``), copy the following command (e.g., select and Ctrl-c) and paste it into your terminal (e.g., Ctrl-Alt-t then right-click -> Paste):

``git clone https://github.com/prof-rice/cse1325-prof.git``

To download changes within your terminal at any later time, change to your cse1325-prof directory (e.g., `cd ~/cse1325-prof`) and type:

``git pull``

If that doesn't work, just delete it and clone it again!

## Working with your local clone

After cloning, you can list text files in bash using

``cat filename``

If you're using the supplied virtual machine, you may edit / view *any* file with an associated application by just typing 

``e filename``

If you're using any other bash shell, something like ``gedit filename`` or ``nano filename`` should work. In a pinch ``xdg-open filename`` should open filename in the application associated with that file type.

If you use Windows or OS X, use your favorite programmed editor to view the code.

## Students from previous semesters

If you have used this repository during a previous semester, be advised that it is restarted each semester. Previous editions have been renamed as shown below (named for start of term in YYYYMM format EXCEPT for 202101, our last semester using C++, for which the "date" is simply cpp). 

And before upcoming students get *too* excited, assignments change *every semester*, so ixnay on any eatingchay plans! ;-)
