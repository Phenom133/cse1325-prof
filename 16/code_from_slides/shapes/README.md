Developing package shapes
=========================

To build, change to a step directory (e.g., ``cd 12-spirograph``)
and type ``ant`` or ``javac src/Demo``.

To run, change to the build directory (e.g., ``cd build``)
and type ``java Demo``.

To automate this process, type

``alias run='ant ; cd build ; java Demo ; cd ..'``

Then you can change to any step directory and simply type ``run``.
