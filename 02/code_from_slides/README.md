Code Shown on the Slides
========================

This directory contains code used during the class lecture or contained in the slides.

---

Type ``ant`` to build all of these programs. Then use ``java Prog`` to run Prog.class.

---

Type ``ant clean`` to delete all of the .class files.

---

This directory also contains a Makefile that works with Java, if you're more comfortable with that. Type ``make`` for guidance. 

But we won't be providing a Makefile for future files. Try to get used to Ant's build.xml instead.
